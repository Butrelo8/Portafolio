## YYYY-MM-DD — Initial stack selection

**Context:** Starting a new micro SaaS project as a solo developer
**Decision:** Hono + Bun + PostgreSQL + Drizzle + Clerk + Stripe
**Alternatives considered:** Express + Node, Fastify + Node
**Why not the others:**
- Express: not TypeScript-native, slower, more boilerplate
- Fastify: more config overhead, less edge-ready than Hono
- Node: Bun is faster, TypeScript-native, simpler DX
